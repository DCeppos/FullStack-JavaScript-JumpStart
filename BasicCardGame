// Steve and Josh are bored and want to play something. They don't want to think too much, so they come up with a really simple game. 
// Write a function called winner and figure out who is going to win.

// They are dealt the same number of cards. They both flip the card on the top of their deck. Whoever has a card with higher value wins the round and gets one point 
// (if the cards are of the same value, neither of them gets a point). After this, the two cards are discarded and they flip another card from the top of their deck. 
// They do this until they have no cards left.

// deckSteve and deckJosh are arrays representing their decks. They are filled with "cards", represented by a single character. The card rank is as follows (from lowest to highest):

// '2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','T','J','Q','K','A'
// Every card may appear in the deck more than once. Figure out who is going to win and return who wins and with what score:

// "Steve wins x to y" if Steve wins, where x is Steve's score, y is Josh's score
// "Josh wins x to y" if Josh wins, where x is Josh's score, y is Steve's score
// "Tie" if the score is tied at the end of the game.
// Example:

// Steve is dealt ['A','7','8']
// Josh is dealt  ['K','5','9']
// In first round, ace beats king and Steve gets one point.
// In second round, 7 beats 5 and Steve gets his second point.
// In third round, 9 beats 8 and Josh gets one point.

// You should return "Steve wins 2 to 1".
